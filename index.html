      <h2>About</h2>
 <p>In the era of a connected world and abundant data, entity resolution and graph alignment have come to play an increasingly important role for ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and quality. Entity resolution identifies and links records referring to the same real-world entities (e.g., people, organizations) despite inconsistencies and has been a cornerstone of data integration with applications in finance, healthcare and various other domains. Graph alignment maps nodes and edges across different graphs taking into account the relationships and structures between the entities with applications such as social network analysis, bioinformatics and knowledge graphs. Both of these tasks share common challenges, particularly in handling large-scale data, requiring efficient solutions and deploying techniques from a great variety of research areas such as database management, big data and parallel processing, machine learning and AI-
based techniques, and others.</p> 
<p>Recognizing the common ground between entity resolution and graph alignment, the goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers, practitioners and experts in both fields to introduce new methods and techniques, discuss open challenges, and explore future research directions. The workshop aims to facilitate the exchange of new ideas in each of the two fields, while also highlighting their shared goals and provide new opportunities for collaborations.</p>
